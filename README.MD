# Personal Agent Quests

This is a personal playground and quest log, running as a simple React application.

## Getting Started

Since this project is isolated from the main workspace, you need to install dependencies locally within this directory.

1.  Navigate to this directory:

    ```bash
    cd personal-agent-quests
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (using npm to avoid modifying the root yarn.lock):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Run the "Good Morning" script:
    ```bash
    npm run goodMorning
    ```

This will start the development server on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
